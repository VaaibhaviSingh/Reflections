What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    A repository is created with no commits in it initially. It needs to be done so that we can track changes made in the files we want to.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
   
    Staging area can contain all the files present in the working directory or maybe a few of them. Files present in the staging area can then be used to commit the changes in the repository.
    It is an intermidiate connection between working area and the repository.
        
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    We can check what changes are we going to add to the repository and do they refer to a single logical changr or not.
